# Welcome to SpaceBook

## Description

A Facebook-inspired social messaging platform, where users can post their thoughts, like and comment on posts.

This was a team project built in two weeks as part of the Makers Academy coding bootcamp. The brief was to create a Facebook clone using Ruby on Rails, a framework new to all of us. We were given a Rails project skeleton to work from.

To develop the app, we followed the client requirements in deciding what features to focus on. We took advantage of several existing gems (libraries) to simplify our work.

## Key Features

- A user can sign up to Spacebook. This is done by entering account name, email and password.
- Once a user has signed up they can login and logout of Spacebook
- No two users can have the same email address or username.
- An email address must be a valid email address otherwise it won't work
- When a user creates a password it must be between 6-10 characters long
- Users can update their user information once they are signed in. This includes - changing email, username and password.
- When a user signs up they are taken to the homepage of Spacebook
